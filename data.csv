",8,6,5,2,2,4,5,6,6,"The interdisciplinarity between the 3 main tracks should be improved. Indeed, open science is not enough as during the research project, members of each track is mainly working on things related to their prior knowledge and not on building new ones.

I hated Openn Science because I ended up in group which wanted to work on things I did not care about.Whereas I loved the CIRP because my group was cohesive and we genuinly wanted to combine our fields. In both cases it depended on luck which is a pity. It's tough because on one hand I think it'd be more efficient to group people based on their interests and on the other hand the people I met during CIRP made me discover new things. It's a hard balance to find. "

Tools allowing us to work into an interdisciplinary field, and learning how to talk to each other.
Its main focus is not related to do a master where we focus on interdisciplinary fields, but more about how to work in one, or even, how to create one.
Interdisciplinary is something subjective as its always relies on how do you define a project. While also, the individual bias will define the project more into one field than another...

Though, it doesn't mean that the CRI has nothing to improve, and they've been improving quite a lot already. But, between the interaction of all the students and enlarging the scopes of thoughts of those students...they might have something to do in that field I suppose."
